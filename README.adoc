= gRPG

An RPG game built by using gRPC services

== How to build

Run the following commands from the root of the project to build and test the dice server:

[source, bash]
----
mvn clean package <1>

java -jar target/dice-0.1.0.jar <2>

grpcurl -import-path src/main/proto -proto dice.proto -plaintext -d '{"ask": "Throw dice"}' localhost:8980 dice.ThrowDiceService/ThrowDice <3>
----
<1> Build the jar with dependencias and the gRPC classes needed for the server to run
<2> Run the server
<3> Test the server with grpcurl

IMPORTANT: The string for asking the value has to be: "Throw dice". If not, it won't return a value.

NOTE: If you want to change the port where the gRPC service is listening. You can change the `DICE_PORT` constant in `src/main/java/io/grpg/dice/Constants.java`
